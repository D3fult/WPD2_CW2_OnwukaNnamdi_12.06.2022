Digital nomad became a trend nowadays due to the pandemic. A lot of professionals can travel anywhere and can choose their desired work environment. Despite working
remotely, it is still essential to take care of yourself. Staying healthy - mentally, and physically is a key aspect for a work-life balance. Agb Ltd. corporation plans to avail a
wellness program for their employees who work remotely. The task is to design and implement a web-based company wellness program for employees of Agb Ltd. corporation.

The application should allow the users the following:
1. Users who are not logged in to see the About Us page with the details of the company wellness program.

2. Registered staff should be able to login and perform the following:
  a. View the details of the wellness program (Fitness, Nutrition, and Mental Health)
  b. Define their own goals schedule on a weekly basis including their achievements. There should be at least 2 or 3 goals per category: (fitness, nutrition, mental, health)
  c. Goals can be added, removed, modified, and defined several weeks ahead.
  d. Goal achievements can be recorded at the time they occur. e.g. goals can be ticked off or actual times or number of repetition can be recorded.

3. Managers should be able to add and delete staff.
